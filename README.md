# Vocab_Builder
This app will be similar to my English Builder app, but designed for various language groups, levels and needs. Users can create their own vocabulary lists to practise. For the moment, the app has a "Demo" mode, where students can practise basic vocabulary for Animals. More importantly, there is a Set-up page, where users can create and edit vocabulary lists. More features will follow.
