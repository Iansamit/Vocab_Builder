# Vocab_Builder
This app will be similar to my English Builder app, but designed for various language groups, levels and needs. Users can create their own vocabulary lists to practise. 

For the moment, the app has a "Demo" mode, where students can practise basic vocabulary for Animals in eight languages ; Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish and Vietnamese. 

More importantly, there is a Set-up page, where users can create and edit vocabulary lists to practise. More features will follow.

The project is contained in a single html file for the moment for ease of download. In the future, it may be split into two branches - one single file, and one separating off script, css, images etc.
